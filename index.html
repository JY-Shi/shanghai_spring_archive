				<h2>Background Story</h2>
				<hr><br>
				<p>This project is named Shanghai Spring Archive (上海之春2022).<br>
				Shanghai was under strict lockdown this spring due to China’s zero Covid policy, during which all citizens had to stay at home and their only chance to go out was to take the PCR tests. A lot of inhumane tragedies happened in that time period: many citizens were starving because of the insufficient food supply or delayed delivery service; sick people didn’t have access to medical care for diseases other than covid 19; employees weren’t paid enough or were fired, many of whom couldn’t afford to pay rents; residents’ households could easily be broken into by Dabai in the name of ‘disinfect’, aka spraying disinfectants over everything, if they were tested positive; any complaints online were censored… Simple words aren’t powerful enough to describe what Shanghainese have gone through.</p>

				<h2>Ideas Behind</h2>
				<hr><br><br>
				<p>In this project, I would like to present a personal memory of my own, from March 7 to June 1. I will include dairies and photos on separate pages, trying my best to provide a clearer picture of my life that time. Since first-hand materials are normally more impactful, I sincerely ask viewers to take the time to immerse in my words, and to feel my desperation and struggle. </p>
				<p>As the saying goes, history has a fun way of repeating itself, and we have seen similar tragedies happening over and over across China – <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20220922/china-covid-zero-policy-bus-crash/" target="_blank">the crashed bus in Guiyang</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-63870896" target="_blank">the fire accident in Xinjiang</a>, <a href="https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/2022/12/06/a103591641.html" target="_blank">the arrested protesters in Shanghai</a>… I hope that this archive can not only be a start of reflection, but also serve as a reminder, warning everyone: FORGETTING ITSELF IS A SIN.
