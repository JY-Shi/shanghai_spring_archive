					<p><br>At the beginning of March, when the epidemic first showed some signs, I was in a great panic of uncertainty, worrying about the freedom that might be lost at any time. When more and more people around you were blocked and managed, and the joke "If you are in Shanghai and no friends around you are quarantined, it means you have too few friends" appeared on the Internet, this anxiety became more and more real. And when the blockade finally came to me, at that time I still believed that the "two-day closed-loop nucleic acid test" would be released again, and I had good expectations for regaining freedom; even closed loop 2+2+2+...+2 unlimited During the extended period, when takeaway and online grocery shopping gradually lacked delivery capacity, I still prayed that all this would end soon. It wasn't until the "rumors" of the closure of the city that Pudong and Puxi could not be circulated since April that I realized that the end of this disaster was still far away. <br><br>The day when I started writing this article was the 42nd day when I was at home. I was trapped in a house in Bailaiping, and my life had already become a simple repetition. I often can't concentrate, and I can't help scrolling through the endless sufferings of the world on my mobile phone. From time to time, I cry a lot in the middle of the night, leaving little time for calm thinking.<br><br>In the abstract I called myself "an average female college student who wasn't the unluckiest or the luckiest," and indeed, I experienced a moderate amount of absurdity. By collecting photos from mobile phone albums, WeChat chat records, and Douban broadcasts, I sorted out this memory of the Shanghai epidemic that belongs to me, hoping to record it as comprehensively as possible from the perspective of ordinary people.<br><br><b>March 5</b><br><br>I went to the Shanghai Zoo with my boyfriend for a day. After posting the photos in Moments, my parents reminded me that "Shanghai has an epidemic recently, so stop running around the world", I didn't take it seriously.<br><br><b>March 7</b><br><br>I saw on Weibo that the quarantine in Shanghai also requires signing the "Consent Form for Harmless Disposal of Pets". I can't believe it, is this still the civilized Shanghai I am familiar with?<br><br><b>March 9</b><br><br>The Jiaotong University next door broke out positive in the early morning, and the school was closed, online classes were started that day, and all staff were nucleic acid tested. In the morning, I asked a friend for confirmation, and she said that it was an employee of the education supermarket who was diagnosed, not a student of the school, so there is no need to worry too much.<br><br>It is rumored that China Normal University will close the school in the near future. It is difficult to explain that I live in the dormitory and do not go home. I had to report to the counselor and then call my parents to confess that I am renting a house. They said it was difficult to accept my decision, we had a big fight, and I cried for half an hour on the side of the road.<br><br>Pedestrians on the road wore masks overnight. In the evening class with Xiuxiu, we both brushed the topic of "Shanghai Epidemic" on Weibo anxiously; when she sent me out of school, she handed me a mask and told me to be careful living alone off campus.<br><br>Xiuxiu also told me that in order to prevent being quarantined as a companion in time and space (being in the same space as an 800*800 square meter with an infected person for more than 10 minutes), she specially set her mobile phone to airplane mode when she took the subway to find her boyfriend in the afternoon. Changing trains at several stops to minimize the risk of being tracked—a couple’s date has become a meeting of secret agents. Is there still a safe place in this city?<br><br><b>March 10</b><br><br>The school's Academic Affairs Office suggested that teachers switch to online classes. After 2:30, which may be the last off-line class of this semester, I entered the Tencent meeting on my mobile phone, and at the same time, I rushed to the Lianhua Supermarket to purchase from the first teaching, and hurriedly bought the last two packs of quick-frozen dumplings in the freezer. Packs of Oreos and bottles of fizzy drinks. The narrow aisles of the supermarket are crowded with people, the shelves of instant noodles have been emptied, and the air is filled with tension. Then I walked out of the school from the small north gate. This was the last time I stepped out of the school gate.<br><br>That day I posted a tiger-wolf statement on Douban: "The short-term survival goal is not to let the frequency of nucleic acid exceed the frequency of sexual life." Who would have thought that the gift bestowed by fate would have already been secretly priced? In less than a week I will pay the price for my former freedom, but isn't freedom a natural right of man? But in our country it has become a gift of fate!<br><br>My boyfriend came to see me at night and we missed a call from the counselor while we were having a good time, causing her to go straight to my parents. We had another big fight on the phone. They were coming to see me the next day, and I was so scared that I packed up the rental contract, pregnancy test sticks and condoms overnight.<br><br><b>March 11</b><br><br>A friend from Jiaotong University told me that they conducted mixed tests on ten people, and 16 groups were positive. It was rumored that the ban would be upgraded and the entire school closed.<br><br>I have never set foot on campus since that day. The school has not been closed yet, but all the classes that day have been changed to online; I want to go to the cafeteria to eat, but I am worried that the school will be closed temporarily like the one in December, and I will sleep in the teaching building without time to escape.<br><br>A row of buildings was sealed off in the community where my home is located, and a nucleic acid test was organized for all staff in the afternoon, so my parents had no time to visit me. Secretly delighted.<br><br>The high school classmate's community is opposite her boyfriend's house, and a confirmed case broke out there, and she was urgently recalled for isolation.<br><br>At that time, the epidemic was still sporadic, and I maintained the habit of refreshing the "Shanghai release" every day to see how far the confirmed cases lived from me, my family and friends. But I began to panic deeply, because my freedom was also at stake.<br><br><b>March 12</b><br><br>This day was the last time I saw my boyfriend before being banned.<br><br>In order to complete the school's nucleic acid statistics, I rode to Wujing Hospital to do nucleic acid at my own expense after waking up. From 10:30 to 12:00, there are migrant workers who don't know how to use the health cloud, short and fat men who play vibrato loudly, and mothers with children in the noisy line. Everyone is very tired in the hot weather. irritable. On the way back, I found out that there was a free test site in the next-door community. I regretted that I had spent 40 yuan in vain and had to suffer the crime of stabbing my nose.<br><br>My boyfriend brought me wontons, shrimp dumplings and pastries from his dad. Like usual weekend afternoons, we lay down and studied separately, and watched "Love Myth" in the evening. I blamed him for being absent-minded to me, but he said that we can meet tomorrow, and there is no need to finish everything in one go. It's a bad day.<br><br><b>March 13</b><br><br>The boyfriend woke up and found that his community had posted a "closed-loop nucleic acid for two days" announcement, and the old man and the old lady had nowhere to go, so they started making noise downstairs.<br><br>East China Normal University issued a notice to close the school at 1 p.m.<br><br>I was never alone on the weekends after being in a relationship, and I was forced to relearn how to be with myself. I went out at noon to find a suitable study room for next week's online class, but found that almost all restaurants banned dine-in or closed business, Baolong Plaza was so depressed that there were no people there, and the community library was also closed. In the end, I only bought a McDonald's cone, went to Wumart Supermarket to purchase some cucumbers and a roast duck, and returned home exhausted. This is my last walk in the free sun.<br><br><b>March 14</b><br><br>A friend from Jiaotong University told me that there were several confirmed cases in her dormitory building. She had never been vaccinated and was afraid of being recruited.<br><br>The community where I rented a house also began to "close the loop for two days". Although the nucleic acid results of my parents' community did not come out and the lockdown was not released on time, I was still confident that I would be able to reunite with my boyfriend on Wednesday; but my boyfriend told me that a diagnosis was made in their community, and the quarantine period was extended from 2 days to 14 days. sky. That afternoon, my parents' community also extended my sentence to 14 days for the same reason.<br><br>The fridge is running out of stock. Dingdong Grocery Shopping, Hema Xiansheng, Meituan, Are You Hungry, Yonghui Supermarket... The major food delivery and shopping platforms are either out of stock or have no delivery capacity, and they have been researching desperately all afternoon. Fortunately, at night, my parents asked my aunt who had not been blocked to bring me some emergency supplies, including oil, salt, drinking water, fruit, cabbage, meatballs, quick-frozen dumplings, instant noodles and biscuits. I think she sent too many things, and it would be a waste if one person couldn't finish them, but she insisted on letting me accept them all, because she was about to enter a closed-loop management with no end in sight.<br><br>In fact, the channel for buying vegetables was not completely blocked at the beginning, and the boyfriend could still order takeaway, and the entrances of the neighborhoods of the three of us were also filled with foam billboards of various vegetable vendors. But considering that I don't know how to cook and have no seasoning, I had to give up.<br><br><b>March 15</b><br><br>On the second day of closed-loop management, I went downstairs to do the second nucleic acid test due to loud loudspeakers. I thought that by cooperating with the property work, I would be able to regain my freedom after completing these two nucleic acid tests. They are completely unaware of the trend of "grid management" in Shanghai, which is to block residential areas under the pretext of "2-day closed-loop nucleic acid", and then use the same reason to extend the prison sentence infinitely 2+2+2; or unfortunately, a confirmed patient is exposed , directly extended to 14 days. Beautiful fantasies accompany me through a peaceful day.<br><br><b>March 16</b><br><br>When I woke up, East China Normal University closed.<br><br>The nucleic acid results of the community have been released, but the lockdown has not been lifted as scheduled.<br><br>At night, the whole school is paying attention to a gossip scandal: a certain male PUA girlfriend in the East China Normal University Physical Education College caused her to commit suicide. All the groups were fried pots, and one course selection group appeared in the live broadcast of the parties; the doubts of the story gradually surfaced, and the host disclosed the Tencent meeting to clarify, but in the end he was forced to apologize under the pressure of the police and admitted that everything was directed and acted by himself. At the same time as the public opinion intensified, the topic of #华师大民男# rushed to the top three Weibo searches, and "traffic female workers" "cleaned the square" for the school's reputation.<br><br><b>March 17</b><br><br>The community started a new round of nucleic acid, and issued a notice stating that "the Street Disease Control Office ordered to recall all recent entry and exit personnel and implement closed management", and barriers were added at the gate. The property does not disclose specific information, nor does it directly respond to when it will be blocked. There is a faint feeling that something is wrong.<br><br>A donation link appeared in Moments, allegedly donating 71 yuan to the school cafeteria. There are many students who reposted and supported it. I can't understand it. I am in the same situation as a pig in a greenhouse, and I still have to send money to the breeder? I sympathize with the logisticians who have to carry out unreasonable orders, but can't express my gratitude for the injustice of the premise.<br><br>The school's publicity trend is also puzzling. The official public account is praising young teachers who live in the office and run to deliver meals to students. At first glance, it seems to be very hard work, but if you think about it carefully, why not use battery cars/other means of transportation to improve transportation efficiency, instead of using the most manpower to achieve the lowest efficiency like the "Human Conveyor Belt" in "The People's Liberation Army in Paris". This kind of publicity idea is actually very representative, and the school's reaction also mirrors the reaction of the whole Shanghai. They are like poor students who are writing hard during the exam, thinking that they can get high marks by scribbling the entire paper.<br><br><b>March 18</b><br><br>Nucleic acid for the fourth time this week.<br><br>My aunt temporarily lifted the lockdown for a few hours, and brought me enough food to last for two weeks.<br><br>Cooking by myself for a week, almost every day is a meal of boiled cabbage dumplings, a meal of bread with fruit/instant noodles and an egg, so I can fool the past. It’s shameful to say that before the lockdown, I had never cooked by myself, and I couldn’t start a fire, let alone wash the pot with dish soap; the novelty of exploring cooking and the sense of responsibility to feed myself together built the order of my solitary life.<br><br><b>March 19</b><br><br>I slept until noon and wrote my homework in the room for a day. In the afternoon, I will give a temporary notice to do nucleic acid, and I will take a turn around to let the air go.<br><br><b>March 20</b><br><br>Received a close text message, and then found that there was one in hand, it was a false alarm.<br><br><b>March 21</b><br><br>Douban was banned for a day, disheartened, and registered on Twitter.<br><br>There are too many irritating things, and I can't sleep until three o'clock.<br><br>In the second year of high school, I learned Kafka in the Chinese class, and went to the Xuhui Library to borrow "The Castle". After flipping through it for a week, I couldn't understand it, so I returned it. But today, watching the WeChat group chat in the dormitory building, the teacher of the Ministry of Education and Engineering output a tai chi speech technique for maintaining stability, how absurd! The students put forward their opinions and confusions clearly and well-founded, and put forward demands for opening the bathhouse and eating better lunch boxes, but these voices were all regarded as "emotional and ignorant", and they used "we are also obeying the command of the superior" to shirk responsibility. Use "it's hard enough for grassroots staff to work together" to divert conflicts. After all, it is impossible for a leader to be wrong, so either the students are too delicate, or the grassroots personnel do not execute properly. I suddenly understood Kafka.<br><br><b>March 22</b><br><br>Waking up in the middle of the night.<br><br>The community has started a new round of closed nucleic acid, the never-ending 2+2+2+...<br><br>The gossip that "Shanghai is about to be closed for a week" has been widely circulated in WeChat groups. Shanghai issued an emergency rebuttal.<br><br><b>March 23</b><br><br>The nucleic acid results have been released two days ago, but the seal has not been lifted as agreed.<br><br>Looking back now, why did I obediently queue up for an hour every time to do nucleic acid? I seemed to obey subconsciously, rather than out of fear of the unknown consequences of "evasion".<br><br>
					East China Normal University has been closed for a week, and it has not been lifted according to the original "7+7" (7 days closed, 7 days closed school). The classmates wailed: "Qiqifuqiqi".<br><br><b>March 24</b><br><br>The parents' community was temporarily unblocked. According to them, in the past few days, the surrounding communities have taken turns to release the wind, giving everyone a few hours to rush to buy in the supermarket.<br><br><b>March 25</b><br><br>Crying late at night, insomnia.<br><br>The rental community organized the residents to apply for the pass, but the property said that it had not received an order from the CDC and could not open the gate of the community. I wanted to call the disease control department to discuss the explanation, but no one answered. At night, I heard cheers downstairs, finally unblocked! I made an agreement with my boyfriend to move in with me after his 14-day quarantine is over. It's a pity that the good times didn't last long. A "Notice to Minhang Residents" was issued, and a new round of blockade will start in two days.<br><br>I wrote on Douban, "The unblocking news made my despair bottom out, but in fact it was to extinguish hope again. Now I can understand what Lu Xun said, 'Despair is illusory, just the same as hope'. The next life will not be reincarnated." I would like to be a person from this place again, and if possible, I hope not to be a person again.”<br><br>Despair is due to expectations. It can be seen that at the time when the government changed its orders and credibility declined, I still hadn't given up my longing for freedom. It took a long period of time to realize that this regime is conducting "obedience tests" and constantly challenging the lower limit of the people, and its attempts are successful.<br><br><b>March 26</b><br><br>Insomnia until three o'clock, which improves daytime efficiency and reserves sufficient time for internal friction in the middle of the night.<br><br>At night, I had a severe pain in my lower abdomen, felt nauseous, and could not move after lying down for half an hour, so I had to seek medical advice on Baidu to scare myself. Later, I couldn't bear it anymore, so I called my parents crying and asked them to pick me up and go home. This was my last move, because going home meant that I would never see my boyfriend again. In short, the two-week "Survival in the Wild" ended like this. On the way home, I felt regretful. My parents seemed to be venting their emotions on me. I didn’t know which sentence I said hit their nerves, and the next second I was yelled at.<br><br>I have observed that everyone has been in a state of collective madness recently. Perhaps the epidemic is just a magnifying glass, infinitely magnifying the pain that should have been endured to an unbearable level. Without the epidemic, these troubles would still exist, in a way that can be alleviated.<br><br><b>March 27</b><br><br>On the first day after returning home, another nucleic acid abnormality broke out in the community, and the process of waiting for the review was panicked.<br><br>The official announcement announced that "a new round of block-based and grid-based nucleic acid screening will be launched across the city." People in Puxi are much luckier than Pudong, and they have 4 more days to stock up. From this day on, the online help-seeking information became complicated, and I saw more and more reposts. As an ordinary person, there is nothing we can do about it, how I wish there was an almighty God to redeem the suffering people!<br><br><b>March 28</b><br><br>My stomach hurts and I cry. Probably because when I lived alone, I cooked by myself without putting oil and water in a pot, and I couldn’t eat the basic metabolism, and I was often hungry. I was constipated.<br><br><b>March 29</b><br><br>Bathe in the sun, hang on to the Tencent meeting, and ride a bike to meet your boyfriend, just to look at each other for a few minutes across the fence. For the next week, I regretted every day that I didn't bring him some food, so he had no choice but to pass it off with instant noodles and porridge.<br><br>Along the way, I saw more true love and suffering in the world. The fishmongers were selling seafood outside the door, and the volunteers between the two fences were in charge of passing the seafood. The old man and old lady who didn’t buy it waved a hundred-dollar bill and shouted, “Don’t leave, I have money, I’m sorry, I’ll sell it to me. Let’s go”; there were also many children who delivered food to their parents who were trapped in the community, and heard a middle-aged aunt say, “Mom, Ala only buys this, so save some food.”<br><br>However, there are still many people on the Internet who do not want to believe what is happening in Shanghai and blindly support the government. I remember the scene in the movie "Nuremberg Trials": the minister of justice was informed of Hitler's crimes in the concentration camp before the trial, and then he sincerely confessed his guilt, saying that ignorance is not an excuse for innocence. Choosing not to believe is also a sin.<br><br><b>March 30</b><br><br>East China Normal University implements district-based management, and the "mixed bathing for men and women" system in the North Campus (the public bathhouse is outside the dormitory building, shared by male and female students in the same area at different times) was fermented on Weibo. interviews and threats.<br><br>I wanted to go downstairs for a walk, and my dad scolded me from "you are a heartless white-eyed wolf" to "you just die outside". The degree of demonization of the virus among the people can be seen. I still couldn't forget these words after walking around the neighborhood. I forcibly held back the tears of grievance, and mustered up the courage to face the fate of continuing to be scolded/cold and violent when I went home. Every day is spent in the cycle of "peace of mind-being scolded and collapsed-self-healing-peace of mind". God knows how many times I have done self-psychological construction not to commit suicide.<br><br><b>March 31</b><br><br>Nothing happened.<br><br>Puxi is about to be blocked across the board, but what difference does it make to me?<br></p>

The first time I posted on matters, I realized the benefits of "freedom of speech". In April, I was deleted countless broadcasts on Douban, as long as they contain "epidemic/nucleic acid/official/government", "run away/run" and other unknown sensitive words, they will be reviewed; Showing half of Pooh's face, Xi mentions the 90-day ban-the whole thing is very dark and humorous. The other account was suspended for 180 days, and the sentence was just over halfway, so I had to register a third account.
<br><br>
The blockade was upgraded throughout April, and I never stepped out of the community. A total of 11 nucleic acid tests were done, on the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 17th, 19th, and 27th. The number of nucleic acid tests was the number of times I went downstairs.
<br><br>
Since staying at home, I have changed from the initial anger to the mid-term fatigue, and finally I can calm down and read some papers, but mental breakdown still occurs from time to time, and I can’t do anything except shed tears. There are 15 or 16 courses a week, and I have to hang up at the Tencent conference for 30 hours. This is also a great torture to my spirit. I have to write 7 papers in the next month, but I don't want to start writing, so I am writing a diary here.
<br><br>
People in my community have been taken away every day recently, so every day is the first day of 14 days for me. It is impossible to take off the hat of "closed area". This is like the fate of the protagonist in "Groundhog Diary", but why do you have to recycle the day when the positive test results in the community?
<br><br>
We no longer look forward to unblocking. Giving up hope is the only way to survive, but without hope, how can we survive?
<br><br>
<b>April 1</b>
<br><br>
I was in an English class when I was told to do nucleic acid, and I didn't want to leave the group discussion, so I was a few minutes late. When I rushed downstairs, I missed the inspection of our building, so I had to mix with the team in the next building. At that time, I was scolded by my parents. It is said that they were ridiculed by the old neighbors because of me. When they heard, "The students from other people's homes also ran down immediately, but your college students love to study?" Are they all killed?" They felt very uncomfortable. Fortunately, no one in the next building chased me away. Everyone said that if I come later, I won’t be able to do it today, but what does it matter if I don’t do it?
<br><br>
In the evening, an unfamiliar number called several times in a row. I suspected it was to check the water meter, and wanted to warn me about inappropriate speeches on the Internet recently. I mustered up the courage to press the answer button. It turned out that the CDC called to inform me that the nucleic acid result was abnormal. At about 11:30, the neighborhood committee came to put a seal on the door. I don't know if the review personnel will knock on the door in the early morning, and I fell asleep uneasy.
<br><br>
From this day onwards, East China Normal University stipulated a new bathing arrangement, requiring that bathing should be divided into floors and dormitories. Only three adjacent dormitories can appear in the bathhouse at the same time. With such complicated arrangements, the aunts living in the building have almost no rest time, and the students are also required to take turns to be volunteers; some dormitories are even arranged to take a bath on the eighth in the morning. More and more students ask the teacher for "bathing leave". This is not the most unfortunate thing. The weather will be hotter and hotter in the next month, but due to stricter requirements, it will take five or six days for the students in the dormitory to take a 20-minute bath. Later, when they went to the bathroom, they had to solitaire in the group and report.
<br><br>
That day, my classmate was dissatisfied with the counselor in the building who used chicken feathers as arrows. When passing by her, she whispered "fuck" in a low voice; The campus card was confiscated and returned only the next day.
<br><br>
<b>April 2</b>
<br><br>
In the morning, the disease control personnel came to the door for a review. They enjoyed the treatment of being stabbed in both nostrils and throat at the same time, and they did not want to experience it again.
<br><br>
The neighbors upstairs and downstairs passed by and found the seal on the door of my house, talking behind their backs. I became a rat crossing the street that everyone shouted and beat, my parents scolded me, and at the same time accompanied the neighbors in the building. Our building was also sealed that day. Apart from creating panic and diverting conflicts, I don't see any need to do so.
<br><br>
It was getting later and later, and I began to worry about the property certificate of the New York University exchange program. If I did not submit the certificate, I would not be able to obtain the DS2019 form, which would affect the visa application. The school requires a deposit certificate within six months; all the family's deposits must be deposited in ICBC, and only ICBC cannot issue a certificate online; there are no relatives or friends who can borrow money and transfer it to other banks. I was in an unprecedented embarrassment, and only my boyfriend understood my anxiety.
<br><br>
On the same day, a recording of a chat between a Shanghai citizen and a female leader of the CDC was released. Citizens questioned the falsified results of the health cloud, unreasonable epidemic prevention policies, etc. The female leader's words "the epidemic has become a political disease, and so much manpower, material and financial resources are consumed to solve this flu-like disease" conveyed everyone's aspirations ( Adding the word "female" here is not a stereotype). Various conspiracy theories appeared on the Internet at the same time. For example, without the support of relevant forces, this recording could not have survived on the Internet. , It is difficult to distinguish between true and false speculations.
<br><br>
<b>April 3</b>
<br><br>
The result of the re-examination has been released, but it was a false alarm. No one came to the door to tear off the seal, so I had to make my own proposal and do it myself.
<br><br>
The most senior counselor of the academy was doing ideological work for the meeting in our dormitory building, and I also attended it. A girl questioned policies such as bathing, box lunch prices, nucleic acid queuing, and material distribution. The counselor once responded with words such as "You are venting your emotions, we need to have a rational dialogue" and "Please use your real name like mine".
<br><br>
<b>April 4</b>

Unlike 2020, when Shanghai was relatively well controlled, I was preparing for the college entrance examination at home; this year Shanghai is the center of omicron and is in a whirlpool of public opinion. As long as you open the social software, you can see heart patients dying because of ambulances, elderly people starving to death at home, terminally ill patients unable to seek medical treatment in time, unbearable pain and jumping to death, mothers and babies forced to separate, embassies evacuated, residents of neighborhood committees All kinds of news, such as expressing helplessness to the elderly who can’t get medicine, and law enforcement officers wearing big white to threaten the masses, often appear in the form of pictures, audio, video, etc., making all this more real. Even if they don’t know the protagonists, they still Like the people around me. I was worried and distressed, and my emotions were easily aroused, because the same disaster could happen to anyone at any time.
<br><br>
The television news, however, presented an alternate world, full of show-like "thanks, thank you," which, not surprisingly, was the only emotion allowed. As usual, the announcer recited the manuscripts of "winning the tough battle of epidemic prevention and control, a protracted war", "fighting a decisive battle to clear zero, and launching a general offensive"; It’s the same as fighting a war”—without enemies, how can the superiority of the system be highlighted? At this time two years ago, I answered "win the battle against poverty and achieve a well-off society in all respects" in the political material analysis questions of the college entrance examination every day. Can't remember a day when we weren't in a "wartime situation".
<br><br>
In order not to be invaded by negative news into my normal life, I logged out of the Weibo that I posted ten times a day. If it is said that I was angry and insomnia in March, since this week I have no anger, only exhaustion and burnout, I only feel that the spark of thinking is gradually leaving my body, and I am becoming stupid. The days of confinement are endless. As an outdoor animal, the average daily steps are more than 10,000 in normal days. On weekends, I go shopping, eat and drink, and often go to coffee shops to study. The past is still unable to adapt to the subversive changes in the order of life. I AM A TOTAL MESS.

<br><br>
The lockdown was supposed to be lifted tomorrow, but was informed that the status quo would be maintained. There is a gossip in the WeChat group, and it is said that the whole city will be unblocked in mid-April. People are still too optimistic. Of course, it is not ruled out that this is an official "leak" of news deliberately, so that the public will not give up hope, and then smash our expectations to pieces, and use warm water to boil frogs to kill our will.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The loudspeaker woke everyone up at six o'clock in the morning, but it was our building's turn to do the nucleic acid test at noon. We hadn't been in the sun for a long time, yet we were treated like animals in a slaughterhouse, made to line up and be driven around. On the way, there was a Dabai who was very fierce and shouted at us not to join the team or whisper to each other. The fellow traveler scolded, "If you wear a suit of leather, you will start to be old." After finishing the nucleic acid test, I went downstairs and shouted to my old neighbors. They said, "Allah is locked up, and all the loops are closed." In the community, I saw rows of sealed residential buildings, traces of burning paper money after the Qingming Festival, Russian shepherd dogs tied to trees, and shoe repairers at the gate of the community for decades. The small cart of "Grandpa Eyes" really has mixed feelings. Everything is now at a standstill.
<br><br>
What can I do? Difficulty concentrating, unable to put down the phone, afraid of 404 messages, because I have experienced countless times that the content I read in the last second will be "unviewable" in the next second, and the posts in the favorites always disappear silently. News that can reflect the suffering of the world abounds, and it is impossible for me to see any change; one more person who sees it can wake up one more person? impossible! You can't wake someone who is pretending to be asleep. But I have trouble reconciling with this powerlessness.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Today the loudspeaker broadcasts in Shanghai dialect. A fat uncle in a blue hood and a blue shower cap greeted me. He was honored to be a volunteer for 200 yuan a day. When I was in middle school, I could see him sitting happily with a dog in the downstairs next door after school every day. How could I have imagined that he would be so majestic one day! He reminded us over and over again to keep a distance of one meter, and scolded the people upstairs who had abnormal nucleic acids not to let them open the windows; it was quite a bit of a "red teenager" momentum.
 <br><br>
Making nucleic acid is the most active time of the day for everyone. The old lady in the team pointed to the lawn and said that this kind of grass can be eaten; the bird breeder said that he had no bird food at home, so they gave him a trick to feed him egg yolk; there are many dogs in hidden corners Shit, it is said that the people in that building secretly hung the dog on a leash for a walk. The windfall was that we found a lot of rotting vegetables at the entrance of the community. "It's not about the scarcity but about the inequality." No one was responsible for distributing them.
<br><br>
Worried about her boyfriend being starved to death. There are only a dozen catties of rice and a few cucumbers left in his house, and he has been drinking porridge for two days. I asked my former classmates all over, and I was pulled into the grocery shopping group in other communities on their street, but none of them could be delivered to his community. If you have money, you can't buy vegetables, but if you are hungry, you can eat porridge. How can you believe that this is Shanghai in the 21st century if you have not experienced it yourself?
<br><br>
<b>April 8</b>
<br><br>
I posted three circles of friends on this day. A "Help! ! ! 》Tweets, one about East China Normal University celebrating the birthday of foreign students and secretly uploading it to the Internet, and one of my hot-searched comments on the latter incident.
<br><br>
My dad saw my circle of friends and scolded me on WeChat, saying, "Can you stop shouting slogans? Everyone knows it, but it can't be solved by shouting slogans. You will be missed if you do this. Thinking that one person has harmed our whole family? We didn’t train you to study to spoil you like this.” We had a big dispute, and I told him, “I’m ashamed to be a Chinese citizen, if The basics of the general environment are like this, so I just hope to run away as soon as possible." This sentence hit his nerves, and he could only hear him throwing things next door, knocking on the table, and yelling at my mother, "I don't recognize her as a daughter." This doesn't scare me, but I can foresee the embarrassing atmosphere of the Cold War tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.
<br><br>
I'm curious about his political stance. How did he manage to criticize the propaganda skills of the TV news on the one hand because of the suffering of the policy and the lack of protection of people's livelihood; He is someone who wouldn't scold Iron Fist even if it hit him on the head.
<br><br>
Confucius said, "If you are admonished by your parents, you will not follow your will, you will respect them without disobeying them, and you will work without complaint." Just like the filial piety of parents, the government cannot criticize unreasonable decisions, but can only be grateful, and there is nothing to do if moderate opinions are not adopted. For someone to say "there is no hope for this country" is enough to humiliate their fragile self-esteem and shatter their faith. Sometimes I don't sympathize with people who suffer because they don't have a long memory and are Stockholm syndrome sufferers.
<br><br>
<b>April 9</b>
<br><br>
After last night's fight, my dad's behavior escalated today. He was "so angry at me that he couldn't sleep all night", he had to be coaxed by my mother to eat lunch, and he refused to sit at the same table with me and run to the room with a bowl to eat by himself; I turn a blind eye. My mother stood by my father as always, saying that I have no conscience and no EQ, brainwashing me and forcing me to apologize. I rejected these requests, saying that I was right, and she uttered cruel words about having a second child.
<br><br>
——When I was growing up, I have long been used to the "doing nothing wrong but making them angry-being cold and violent/threatened not to cook for me or send me to school-force me to apologize" mode of getting along. The first and longest episode of cold violence lasted for more than a week, which brought great panic to me as a primary school student. When I was bullied, I was always cautious, not daring to make a sound; when my head was pressed to apologize, my heart was full of grievance and humiliation, but I had no choice, I was really afraid that they would not send me to school. Fortunately, I have gradually become numb today, but this cycle is still unbearably frequent, which is why I insist on renting an apartment. Their way of thinking is giant, I'm the only thing they can control, and it's only in the anger-threat-apology cycle that their authority is constructed. So misshapen.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Today is the 29th day of my boyfriend being blocked. Since March 23, the neighborhood committee has distributed 8 waves of supplies, but each time they distributed them in less than two days. He couldn't order takeaways, so he had to eat instant noodles every day; when the stock of instant noodles was exhausted, leaving only rice and cucumbers, he made the porridge thicker and ate it with pickled cucumbers. During the video with me, he said from time to time that he was very hungry, so hungry that he didn't want to talk.
<br><br>
This Friday, the 50 yuan vegetable gift pack he bought through the neighborhood committee finally arrived (it is reasonable to suspect that the neighborhood committee is reselling the supplies). Team Leader Lou is a retired grandfather and told him that he can only pay in cash. A community that cannot even use electronic payment shows how serious the aging rate is! Their entire community can't make up the Meituan community group meals that start at 60 cents. So far, they haven't found any group buying groups, and they can't buy any food through other channels. Young people who know how to use mobile phones are like this. Can’t believe how the elderly, who account for more than two-thirds of the residents, will spend those days, relying on the survival experience of the famine era?
<br><br>
It was rumored that Sun Chunlan would come to inspect Xuhui District tomorrow, and the neighborhood committees of the streets went door to door in the middle of the night to put up seals, and were stopped halfway through because of "formalism". People panic.
<br><br>
Watching a movie, the earphones couldn't cover the roar of the woman downstairs. She barked for several days. I don't know if she is crazy or there is something urgent at home? The neighbors upstairs always like to use Xiao Ai as a stereo, playing songs that are not very pleasant. The joys and sorrows of people are not the same.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Two days ago, Shanghai released rumors that "restricting group buying" is not true, but the government's credibility has reached the point where people have to listen to irony. Today, a group buying group I belonged to was blocked by guards and refused to allow purchases. The group members could only watch the oranges piled up on the street; In the end, the two sides compromised and dragged dozens of boxes of oranges back to the community for distribution in the dark.
<br><br>
Friends who live with their boyfriends tell me that condoms are sky-high. She didn't expect that the mandarin ducks in the cage could not have sex because they couldn't buy condoms. She joked that it was the country's economic downturn and took the opportunity to deliberately increase the birth rate.

When you wake up every day, the countdown to unblocking will be reset. I didn't murder and set fire, but it seemed that I was sentenced to life imprisonment, even worse than the prisoners in the prison.

Watching the solid colors outside the anti-theft window, watching them disappear little by little. The sun is just right, but if it can't shine on everyone, what's the point of the sun's existence?

<b>April 12</b>
<br><br>

In the morning, I was dragged downstairs to do nucleic acid again, this time for three consecutive days.
<br><br>

Doing nucleic acid allows me to meet those people who are usually invisible. Every time the horn blares to the next building, the idiot's family on the top floor is dispatched, but they are always the last to arrive, because idiots are afraid of heights, and it takes more than ten minutes to walk the six flights of stairs. In the procession, I also saw an old man with a urine bag tied around his waist, being supported by his grandmother and enthusiastic neighbors to move forward at a slow pace. There are still elderly people in wheelchairs in the Boyfriend Community. There is no elevator in the old-fashioned community, and it depends on the kind neighbors to lift them up and down.
<br><br>

A new era has quietly arrived. The boyfriend's parents are in Zhangjiagang, ushering in the best business day of their lives. Selling pork like a day for decades, usually deliver the goods in the early morning, and go home to rest at noon; even during the Chinese New Year, I will only be busy until the afternoon. After the news of the closure of the city came out, two thousand catties of meat were sold a day, and they were still running outside at eight or nine o'clock. The ribs soared to 60 yuan a catty, and customers rushed to buy them, even young people who didn't cook well joined in. ——The GDP loss caused by the closure of the city is expected to be recovered by panic buying.
<br><br>


NYU Amnesty passed my ineligible property certificate. I thought everything would be fine, but the DS2019 must be mailed in order to apply for a visa. I don’t know when UPS Shanghai will be able to receive international express delivery. Besides, the U.S. embassy in China is organizing the evacuation, and I am afraid that it will not be able to apply for visas in Shanghai by then.
<br><br>

The incident of girls peeping at men in the bathroom of East China Normal University last night continued to ferment on Weibo. The school did not deal with the boy, but dealt with the girls who actively spoke out, and everyone's anger was ignited. What makes me even more sad is that the collective memory will not be preserved, the anger will not be transformed into actual power, and the processing mechanism will not be perfected. The basic plan will always be to protect the peepers more than appease the victims, and similar incidents will not be properly handled in the future.
<br><br>



<b>April 13</b>
<br><br>

Those who do nucleic acid work harder and harder.
<br><br>

There is no WeChat group for the boyfriend, and any notifications are made through the horn and the throat. The team leader of the building patted the door three or four times in the morning. He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown and always hallucinating someone knocking on the door.
<br><br>

— We seem to be being raped by the entire giant epidemic prevention machine.
<br><br>

The group buying group in the community shows the appearance of all beings under the blockade. Someone asked to buy glutinous rice balls. She and her parents lived in different buildings in the same community. During the closure of the building, they could not pass on supplies, and her father was demented, so he only ate glutinous rice balls for lunch. time to eat. Someone’s family member had advanced lung cancer, and the targeted drug was discontinued for a few days; a kind person replied that some unfinished medicine was left behind after the family member passed away from lung cancer. I wonder if it is a brand?
<br><br>

Several gentle friends have exchanged "Runxue" with me. There are programmers who have been brushing up questions for the past six months and preparing to switch to BAT, and there are students from prestigious schools who aim to enter state-owned enterprises after graduation. They expressed complete disappointment with the party either because of the unreasonable anti-epidemic policy or because of the main theme of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of "fighting female boxing". I enthusiastically shared some immigration information, but I know very well that I am only disappointed now, which shows that the endurance is good enough, and it also shows that the memory is not long; after the lockdown is lifted for a while, they will soon forget everything they have experienced Ridiculous, and why it is experienced.
<br><br>



<b>April 14</b>
<br><br>

At a quarter past nine, I was sleeping soundly in bed, and the counselor made two phone calls. Trying to remember what she said wrongly recently may have committed a crime, but she came to "communicate" with me about the peeping incident. Are you afraid that I will become an unstable element again?
<br><br>

I didn’t wake up and my mind was dizzy, so I just said: 1) This incident is similar to the chat records of the boys in Building No. 7 when the school was closed in December (the school was also closed at that time, and there was a rumor in the boys’ dormitory group that “send girls who can’t go home In the building, the fat ones will be sent to Brother X’s room, and the fit ones will be sent to Building Y” to varying degrees; 2) I hope you don’t cover your mouth, and the information is open and transparent, especially the public punishment information; 3 ) Emotions are useless, it is basically to take the opportunity to improve the processing mechanism.
<br><br>

Her response was: 1) Thought crime is not a crime, and insulting remarks do not cause actual harm, and being convicted of a crime for words will cause everyone to feel in danger; 2) The school does make a difference, and peeping at that position can see nothing Qing, the logistics later strengthened the windows and fences, these actually put an end to the problem, and punishing the relevant students will not help solve the problem, and she said that the communication channels of the students are unobstructed, and you can talk to her directly if you have anything; I emphasize again The request for information disclosure, requesting the government to disclose the processing progress; 3) She did not respond directly. She seems to want to unilaterally emphasize the school's contribution to me, but avoids why the information is not made public.
<br><br>


<b>April 15</b>
<br><br>

The students in the circle of friends forwarded the "Joint Letter on the Handling of the East China Normal University Peeping Incident", and I also participated in the real-name joint name.
<br><br>



<b>April 16</b>
<br><br>

Due to nucleic acid abnormalities in all districts after the closure of the school for more than a month, East China Normal University introduced a new policy: the bathing schedule is stricter, and basically each person can only wash once every five or six days; if you buy a boxed meal with a meal coupon, you need to send one person to each dormitory Representatives went to the cafeteria; each building went downstairs to let the wind out at different times, and volunteers and patrol teachers strictly monitored.
<br><br>


At 7:30 in the morning, I was awakened by the sound of knocking on the door to do nucleic acid in my dream, and I got up with a stomach full of anger. Older people go downstairs more slowly, and by the time Grandma gets out of bed, gets dressed, and goes downstairs, everyone else in the building has finished. And because grandma's blood pressure medicine could not be dispensed, and her blood pressure even soared to two hundred, mixed with the neurasthenia of being called out again and again, my dad directly quarreled with Dabai, who maintained order—grandma had chronic nephritis and pulmonary fibrosis Chemicals and resistance are inherently poor, and they cannot withstand the ups and downs and the risk of cross-infection; the neighborhood committee does not care about people's livelihood work such as dispensing medicine, and will only waste meaninglessly in nucleic acid inspections.
<br><br>

The real breaking point was that when mixing tubes for nucleic acid, the previous tube was short of one person, which meant breaking up our family, and my dad didn't want to. He said on the table, open a new test tube, otherwise we will not do it; he said "no, I will come back later", but there are still a few families who do not want to be dismantled. I was also furious, and yelled at him, how much medical resources have been wasted, only this one person is missing? Then we announced that we would never participate in similar nucleic acid tests in the future, and we were blown away. Our roar froze the air in this small monitoring point, and the noisy crowd fell silent; what were they thinking? Why not join us in the revolt? ? ?
<br><br>

There's no point in arguing with Dabai, they're just following orders. But besides fighting among ourselves, can we people do anything else? We are all in a state of disunity, unable to unite. When I got back downstairs, I scolded my mother with my neighbors, and I heard "Cen that mother's forehead b" in my ears; the people's brains are also clear, and they also know that this is formalism. But why are we so docile? I even have an urge to organize everyone to resist nucleic acids. But I don't have this power, my parents are afraid that I will cause trouble, and they won't even let me join the building group.
<br><br>

Going back to bed aggrieved, the circle of friends saw that the father of the high school mentor passed away in the nursing home, and because of the inconvenient access, he couldn't even see him for the last time. Her words broke my heart. All kinds of tragedies, how long will they last on this land?
<br><br>



<b>April 17</b>
<br><br>

Some people's faces disgust me, and I won't sympathize with them anymore.
<br><br>


At eight o'clock, the building started to be restless, urging each other to get up quickly to do nucleic acid, but it was not our turn at nine o'clock.
<br><br>

Yesterday, it was unanimously decided not to let grandma go downstairs to avoid the risk of cross infection. After being woken up full of resentment, my parents yelled at my grandma and told her not to worry about anything. I said that nucleic acid is meaningless, and the whole building should unite and refuse to do it; but they threatened me, do I have to be arrested by the police? There was so much quarreling, I wanted to go directly from the window on the third floor jump down. My dad put on a victim stance, saying that we were so angry that he had a splitting headache, and yesterday he was so angry that his chest was tight all day; when it was finally our turn, he arrived at the inspection point and found that he didn't bring his mobile phone, so he told my mother to run back take. It's so rubbish, I don't know what to say...
<br><br>

After I went downstairs, I didn't give up encouraging everyone to unite and resist nucleic acid, but the hearts of the people were not united. They just insisted that different buildings should not be mixed (in fact, this is meaningless). On the way back and forth, they complained to each other, saying that the throat was stabbed until it was disgusting, the nerves were made nervous by the unfixed nucleic acid time, and it was too much trouble to go back and forth. After hearing this, I felt sick for a while. I only complained and didn't dare to resist. They are so bad, they deserve it!
<br><br>

What's even worse is that they have a mentality of "burning jade and stone together", dare not reflect on the irrationality of the policy, and instead point the finger at people like themselves. They don't scold the government, they don't scold Dabai, they scold the neighbors who don't go downstairs on time, and scold those who want to resist.
<br><br>

They, like most Chinese, continue to pretend to be asleep after being woken up. I asked my mother why? "I'm an ordinary person and I want to live," she said. But is it like this to live like a pig and a dog? Why don't you have the courage to fight for a dignified life? I'm so suffocated.
<br><br>



<b>April 18</b>
<br><br>

The boyfriend's father entrusted his acquaintances in Shanghai to bring him more than a dozen catties of pork. The neighbors in the building poked their heads out, and some directly waited downstairs. They decided that their boyfriend couldn't make it, so they volunteered to claim it and took it home, saying that they would cook it as braised pork and small soup for him; this was exactly what he wanted.
<br><br>

Since he is the only out-of-town tenant in the building, even though Jiangsu dialect is 80% similar to Shanghai dialect, he still feels alienated from his neighbors, which is why he refused to ask for help last week when he starved to death. This exchange is also a good opportunity to eliminate the invisible barriers between neighbors.
<br><br>

After trying various channels to buy grandma's high blood pressure, my parents got a pass today and drove to all pharmacies in Xuhui District. Drugstores can't use medical insurance discounts, and hundreds of medicines are twice as expensive as usual, but it's lucky to be able to buy them at this time.
<br><br>

<br><br>


I cried again in the middle of the night. <br><br>




<b>April 20</b><br><br>


Two observations:
<br><br>

I found that we like to use the expression of younger age. The layoffs of major Internet companies are called "graduation", the nucleic acid test is called "quick test", the last nucleic acid test before unblocking is called "graduation exam", and the supplementary nucleic acid is called "make-up exam". In fact, those who complain about doing nucleic acid every day but do not resist are like good students in the class. Even if the teacher assigns unreasonable homework, they must finish it carefully and exclude those students who raise opinions rationally.
<br><br>

The little pinks are very interesting, they can achieve logical self-consistency while being separated. Indulging in the beautiful fantasy of self-construction, they gain a sense of security by attacking "foreign forces".

The positive patient upstairs from the boyfriend was finally taken away three days after his diagnosis. He optimistically shared the cabin life in the building.
<br><br>

A famished weasel attempted to climb up the sewer pipe to the fourth floor, and jumped from the window into her boyfriend's kitchen to feed.

There are a group of domesticated people in the rented building. They live broadcast how the people in the positive building opposite sneak out for a walk, walk from the open door on which floor to the opposite building, and take the stairs back at what time. These are all reported clearly. Chu. The property management has no time to ignore their reports.
<br><br>

There was a diagnosis in the high school classmate's building, and the neighborhood committee was afraid that people would run around, so they called the electrician to weld the door shut. I thought it was ridiculous at the time, but it was just the beginning of the next "hard isolation".
<br><br>



<b>April 23</b>
<br><br>


Yesterday, there was a phenomenon-level forwarding of "Voice of April" in the circle of friends, and even high school teachers in the system participated in it. Today, as expected, I started to delete posts and ban accounts on a large scale.
<br><br>

The thing that chills me the most since the epidemic is covering my mouth. As small as schools control comments on Weibo, directly check IP to locate students, find parents, and intimidate; as large as the national level, WeChat explodes accounts, Douban deletes posts, and Weibo "clamps". The more you cover your mouth, the more rebellious everyone will be.
<br><br>


Why don't you agree with me, but come here to comment on me? pose as an educator
What are we fighting against when we relay relay? The end of this video will be the same as the tweet about Dr. Ai Fen's "The Whistleblower" in 20 years. Even if it is translated into a foreign language or Martian language, the final destination is 404. The creator of the video was also taken away for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble."
<br><br>

At the same time, there were voices in the circle of friends who opposed the reposting of "Voice of April", and a teacher who has always respected reposted related suggestions. nausea. Aren't they afraid that one day misfortune will happen to them? Why are you afraid of hearing different negative voices?

Our community has distributed 6 waves of supplies in the past 8 days. Many of these materials were requisitioned from the group buying merchants, which led to the group buying goods being in the hands of others, and what I got was other people’s group buying. Of course, some donations from other provinces are not ruled out, but the solution to the Shanghai problem is not to engage in "" Planned economy", but unimpeded shopping channels.
<br><br>

These people have no sense of taxpayers and are grateful for what they get. They don't understand this is their legal right at all. Sending out some supplies is enough to shut their mouths.
<br><br>



<b>April 25</b>
<br><br>

In the morning, my boyfriend was woken up again. It turned out that the neighbors in the next building questioned why the defense building could not go out, and they yelled at each other as "Cen that mother's old b" with the volunteers, and almost called 110 for comment. It is said that the volunteers don't have to do anything, just sit in white and play King of Glory at the gate of the Fengkong building, and they can get a subsidy of 200 yuan a day.
<br><br>


Even if I have the money to get it, I am not willing to be a volunteer to serve the absurd power. I remember that "garbage sorting" was first advocated in 2019. The community recruited volunteers to guard the trash cans. Every day at noon and night for two hours, you can get one hundred dollars. Retired grandparents and aunts rushed to do it.
<br><br>

From this day onwards, "hard isolation" will be enforced. Even if a tragedy has occurred in a community in Pudong, the fire cannot escape, and the residents on the top floor jump off the building, it will not stop the magic. Friends’ homes have installed iron railings one after another, and the remote areas where my boyfriend and I live seem to be implementing slower. At night, there were protests in their community, and the police came to suppress them.
<br><br>

Watching "Les Misérables" and hearing "Do you hear the people sing", thinking of the recent oppression, I burst into tears.

My parents' friend entered the shelter last Thursday, and it became cloudy the next day. I was supposed to go home yesterday, but due to insufficient transport capacity, I was pulled from Shangsai, which was in good condition and could take a bath, to Clover, which was leaking in a rainy day and had no toilet. This group of young people resisted collectively, and finally followed the car and was pulled back to the race, but they were not accepted. After tossing back and forth all day, I finally sent someone to send them back to my home today. It's hard to imagine what it would be like for seniors to go through this bumpy road.

A new function has been quietly launched in the portable code, and two buttons appear, "return to work permit" and "passport". Is it about to be unblocked?

Single person and single tube for nucleic acid.
<br><br>

I realized that doing nucleic acid is largely the source of my pain, to be woken up by the loudspeaker, and then be on call at any time.
<br><br>

To some extent this has become a social movement, the Cultural Revolution 2.0. Madness and normality were reversed. I was even required to wear disposable gloves when I went out, and I sprayed wildly on everything I touched. Some people are dehumanized, positive patients are called "sheep", and medical workers are called "Dabai" - what is the difference between this and the "ghosts and snakes" at that time?

<b>April 28</b>
<br><br>

The situation faced by this year's senior year is much more severe than 2020.
<br><br>

The Shanghai Education Bureau announced that the grade test was postponed, but did not say when it would be postponed.
<br><br>

The mother on the top floor of the opposite building stepped out of the window and shouted to the loudspeaker, "Stop making noise, our child is taking an exam!", but the loudspeaker ignored her.
<br><br>



<b>April 29</b>
<br><br>

Grandma quietly went downstairs and was captured by surveillance, and her photo was posted in the building group. Parents felt that the society was dead.
<br><br>


We all want to know, what is the significance of nucleic acid again and again?
<br><br>


<b>April 30</b>
<br><br>

Shanghai released a report yesterday that "social clearing" has been achieved. We all know that data can be falsified, they are like little girls who can be dressed up. It can be seen that the celebration banquet will be held soon! They announced the happy news of the funeral and used "another great victory of the party" to cover up the essence of the humanitarian disaster.
<br><br>

The people are exhausted, and they don't care which way it is, as long as this disaster is over quickly.
<br><br>

I only hope that the "Shanghai dead", those innocent souls who died innocently, can be remembered by more people.

<br>
I can't cry anymore. Denial, anger, bargaining, frustration, acceptance, this is the acceptance process of facing one's own destiny, and I have successfully transitioned to the final stage.
<br><br>

The prolonged blockade has rendered the concept of time meaningless. When was the last time you washed your hair? What's the date today? I don't remember anything. How many more turns of the hands of the clock before I can be free again? How many more times must the sun rise and set before I can meet my boyfriend again? I AM CONDEMNED TO THE INFINITY OF TIME.
<br><br>

I realized that it is impossible to restore the normal order of life, and the Shanghai after this turmoil of white terror will no longer be the same Shanghai as before. Civilization, the rule of law, quality, these values that originally belonged to Shanghai collapsed; madness, chaos, and fear will replace them as the new living conditions of Shanghainese.
<br><br>

I no longer expect to change something or wake up someone. I am so tired, I just want to survive in the troubled times.

<b>May 1</b>
<br><br>

The circle of friends was swamped by the scandal of high school classmates, about a boy from the School of Medicine of Jiaotong University running an account on Twitter and fantasizing about girls around him; Many people use it as some talk about the boring and controlled life. I read those Twitter screenshots word by word, and I felt chills in my hands and feet, and I couldn’t imagine how many explicit or covert male gazes women have to endure in their daily life; but friends who studied the Fa told me that the photos posted by social networking sites Publishing bottomless obscenities does not violate the criminal law, which is not even as serious as the crime of breaking the wall. I also don't know exactly how the boundaries of sexual harassment are drawn.
<br><br>

There's nothing wrong with arguing with my boyfriend at night because he won't help me with my math homework. The quarrel that can't meet each other is too hurtful, and I apologized after a while. I really miss the days when we could make love after a fight.
<br><br>

The ultraviolet lamp bought by my parents has arrived, and it is said that it is a product promoted by Douyin-this is undoubtedly another IQ tax. Afterwards, no matter whether it was the materials distributed by the neighborhood committee or the clothes they replaced when they went out to do nucleic acid tests, they insisted on spraying alcohol with gloves on, and turned on the ultraviolet light to disinfect the toilet for an hour. The ubiquitous virus is wiped out. The epidemic prevention campaign has reached this level, and the people at the bottom have been unconsciously coerced into it, and they have become neurotic about unnecessary things. They will not listen to persuasion. Many times I have been dizzy and nauseated by the pungent smell of ultraviolet lamps (probably ozone?), and they only attribute it to psychological effects.
<br><br>


Where there is no science, what else is there to talk about? 
<br><br>




<b>May 3</b>
<br><br>

The Academic Affairs Office officially notified that all the final exams of professional courses in this semester will be changed to papers. It's like notifying the postponement of the college entrance examination in 20 years. If I am amnesty, I can continue to hang on to the Tencent meeting to fish. At least you don't have to endure 28 hours a week of boring classrooms in a closed environment.
<br><br>

At night, the loudspeaker drove all the residents downstairs home, saying, "Another positive case was found in the community today." We haven't done nucleic acid for several days, maybe it's from a closed building?
<br><br>



<b>May 4</b>
<br><br>

The sun was just right, and I woke up sweaty in the morning, probably because summer was coming. If the weather is normal, I will definitely drag my boyfriend out to go shopping and take pictures. But I haven’t gone out for too long, and I have learned to self-castrate myself ; writing papers day after day, my life is reduced to a macbook, reading literature, typing on the keyboard, watching dramas, and browsing social networking sites. Thesis pressure keeps me from going mad again, I'm deprived of the ability to desire . Occasionally watching street view videos posted by citizens of the prevention zone on YouTube is really ridiculous. It is a way to spy on the "outside world".
<br><br>

Grandma stared at the TV in a daze all day long, or lay down in front of the window and looked at it, chanting words over and over in her mouth, "Our ancestors bless our family to be safe and healthy." She either stared at her family to see what they were doing, or watched the gossip of the neighbors wherever she could; but the strange thing was that she never watched the news and had no idea of the changes the real world was going through. Whether there is an epidemic or not, her life is the same. It seems that time will naturally stagnate when people get old. It is saved at a certain memory point like a game, and new data will no longer be read . The closed living environment allows me to see all this more clearly.
<br><br>



<b>May 5</b>
<br><br>

Started a new round of nucleic acid. After being woken up at 8 o'clock, I fell asleep again, so I didn't go downstairs to do it.
<br><br>

At the dinner table, my parents said that the people of Xuhui should be grateful for the rich supplies distributed by the government, unlike Baoshan and other suburban governments who are the people’s “stepfathers and stepmothers” (pronounced as “Man Ye Man Niang” in Shanghai dialect). Really fed up with this family narrative.
<br><br>



<b>May 6</b>
<br><br>

At 12:30 in the middle of the night, there was a faint noise from a loudspeaker urging people to do nucleic acid in the distance. At first I thought it was an auditory hallucination. It wasn't until the sound got closer and the old man stuck his head out and cursed that I realized I heard it right. The fear and anxiety of April have come back, and the balance I finally found will be broken by the sudden nucleic acid at some point. What else can ordinary people do? At best, curse the executor's family for enduring the same suffering, and pray that the policy makers die soon.
<br><br>


My friend told me in despair that as long as the number of new cases does not decrease and the CCP continues to adhere to the zero-clearing policy, the epidemic will never end. Isn't this exactly the state of life in "1984"? The abnormal state is normalized, and daily language is militarized. Just like "Oceania is always at war with Eastasia", we are launching a "tough, protracted, and general offensive" to fight the epidemic every day.
<br><br>

At the same time, the mainstream media arrogantly preached to young people that "we grew up in the best of times". The individual person behind the grand narrative is invisible. In a system that claims to strive for the health of the people, self-appoints itself to take on historical responsibilities, insists on a sense of procedural justice, and speaks high-level civilized words, a zero-clearing plan dedicated to violating the laws of nature takes shape. Now, this bureaucratic system full of slogans and distorted actions has exported countless Eichmann-like screws. This is why I see "Wanhu Conference" has a strong sense of substitution.
<br><br>

NYU sent me DS2019 with FedEx, I hope it is a good sign that Shanghai starts to receive international express.
<br><br>


<b>May 7</b>
<br><br>

In the middle of the night, there were sporadic reposts about the incident of "Sneaking in the East China Normal University" in Moments. It was less than a month since the "411 bathroom peeping" incident, and the joint letter we submitted has not yet been answered.
<br><br>

The story of the incident was roughly that two male volunteers took advantage of their positions to secretly photograph a girl in pajamas shopping for food with a video camera, and then circulated the photos in group chats and sexually obsessed with them. It's normal to not wear underwear, but their foul language has a bad public impact. The girls who forwarded it in the circle of friends expressed empathy and anger, while the boys were busy cutting seats to defend.
<br><br>

We know that our retweeting is impossible to get a response from the school, and it will only fall into a cycle of public opinion crisis-platform current limit-stability maintenance class meeting-fading out of view-similar incidents happen again. However, a self-organized small group responsible for promoting the resolution of sexual harassment in our school was active until late at night, discussing how to create public opinion in order to attract more people's attention, in order to pressure the Ministry of Education and Industry to respond, and related tweets were not sent out until four o'clock. However, the official account was reported at noon, and the WeChat account of the students who posted the text was blown up, and the students received calls from the police. I knew my mouth would be covered, but I didn't expect it to come so quickly.
<br><br>


That afternoon, the incident of "a boy from a history normal school touching a girl's thigh" broke out, which only caused a little splash.
<br><br>



<b>May 8</b>
<br><br>

The Shanghai Municipal Education Commission finally issued a notice on the postponement of the high school and college entrance examinations, requiring classes to resume before the exams. In other words, there is hope for a large-scale unblocking this month?
<br><br>

In the past few days, nothing happened if I didn't go downstairs to do nucleic acid, and my parents finally acquiesced that I was free from the rules. I just don't understand why they follow such a ridiculous policy.
<br><br>

In the morning, my parents quarreled again because they stopped grandma from going down to do nucleic acid. They yelled, "If you go downstairs to do nucleic acid, don't come back, we don't recognize you." The more this happened, the more paranoid grandma made noise. After losing his temper, my father acted like a stove cat, waiting for my mother to pat his back and rub his shoulders. It wasn't long before they were quarreling about something else, almost every day. Originally influenced by them, I also hated my grandma a little bit, and regarded her disobedience as the reason why my father was unwell and unable to go out to work; but I heard my mother say, "Your son has only half life, and you still have to kill him." ", I felt very harsh, and began to sympathize with grandma, she was just a victim. ——My boyfriend said that my family has a lot in common with Hillbilly in the southern state of the United States. Both have fixed assets (land or houses), parents do not have serious jobs, the family atmosphere is extremely conservative, and the children either grow up to be as control freaks as their parents or Very rebellious, so we can call it a shanghaiese trash family.
<br><br>

It was the first time I ate fish since the lockdown. It is said that in order to thank my parents for helping to dispense the medicine, the neighbor specially gave us half of the herring that his son caught that day and flashed it to us. See neighbors in special times.
<br><br>



<b>May 9</b>
<br><br>

The counselor was on the phone for almost an hour. She first asked me my opinion on the candid filming incident, and then corrected them one by one:
<br><br>

1) crime equivalent? Staying in school for observation is already a very serious punishment for the bathroom voyeur, and it cannot be eliminated in the file. However, the behavior of secretly taking and distributing the photos of girls' bumps did not cause any real harm to the girls, so it was only a notice of criticism. We have to go back to the facts and deal with it fairly under the existing system.
<br><br>

2) Why not disclose the punishment and information of peeping men? Because such incidents are required by law to protect the information of both parties.
<br><br>

3) Did you cover your mouth? She said she never prohibited the discussion of the matter herself, and asked to delete the post because it contained false content. In addition, it is unwise to leave things to marketing accounts and traffic, because you cannot control the direction of public opinion.
<br><br>

4) The sexual harassment system is perfect. Why not respond to the joint letter? Because the school's recent focus is on epidemic prevention, there is no time to improve the system and deal with students' demands. Perhaps in the future, problems can be solved within the system, such as equal communication with the Ministry of Education and Industry, such as selecting students to submit proposals to the school congress and the National People's Congress.
<br><br>

5) Don't generalize and make assumptions. Female groups tend to assume the role of victims and look at the problem itself irrationally. To return to the event itself.
<br><br>

I've been really tired recently, and I can't refute, and the refute itself is meaningless and will not produce results. So after I finished my opinion, I said "ummm, yes" the whole time. In the end, she expressed her relief, thinking that I can be taught by a child. From not getting a drop of water in the freshman year to learning to listen in the sophomore year, it is indispensable for her to call me and talk to me. She really felt that she had saved a child who had gone astray. She did help my growth, but in another sense, it taught me to slowly put on the disguise.
<br><br>

People like her are lucky after all, because she relies on a "doublethink" method similar to 1984 to convince herself that she lives in a world where ideals and reality are integrated, and the smooth approach in this society is completely logical to her of. And people like me can only live in pain for so long, coz damn I can't live with this shitty system .
<br><br>

On the same day, I reviewed the video in my diary and compared the handling of sexual harassment incidents in mainland and Hong Kong universities. A very interesting discovery is that Hong Kong school students told me that they would use the politically correct public opinion environment to kill the perpetrators, but they rarely resorted to public powers such as campus sexual harassment agencies. Hong Kong people often only ask the public power not to do something, but not what it should do; while mainlanders yearn for Bao Qingtian's reincarnation in their bones, to uphold justice for the unarmed civilians. We have no tradition of civil society.
<br><br>

However, the main prerequisite for Hong Kong schools to do so is a consensus on sound systems, freedom of speech, and political correctness. We have a long way to go in promoting a mechanism to resolve sexual harassment. Is it only within the system? I don't know, I can only look at the round moon.
<br><br>


<b>May 10</b>
<br><br>

It is said that this is the last day of this round of nucleic acid, and I will slowly let it go. I decided to go downstairs to do nucleic acid. But because there is no data from the previous few days, in order to avoid more troubles, my mother asked me to pretend to be a middle school student without a mobile phone.
<br><br>

As the daily increase in Shanghai has gradually changed from tens of thousands to several thousand, and has declined at a rate of one thousand per day in recent days, I predict that there will be "low-level platform fluctuations" at the stage of daily increase of one or two thousand. It is not based on any scientific basis, but based on past experience, how can we not correct people? It is also a test of obedience to let people have expectations for arbitrary numbers .
<br><br>

The counselor suddenly called me again in the middle of the night. She first clarified to me the facts of the candid photo incident: the person who posted the microblog was not a classmate of our school, he distorted and exaggerated the matter, the boy involved only spread the photo in a private chat, and it was directly sent to the subject after only two people. Candid shots of girls (——inner os: It is too common to criticize us for being rhythmic with details). Then for the purpose of protecting me, I put forward three requirements: 1) Speak out based on facts; 2) Be cautious when speaking in group chats with people outside the school, they may create public opinion for the sake of traffic; 3) Do not participate in activities organized by forces outside the school Activities can only solve problems within the system. She said that I was the only student she talked to so hard, and she saw a side that was too idealistic and pure in me, and hoped that I would be more down-to-earth and do practical things.
<br><br>



<b>May 11</b>
<br><br>

My favorite teacher in the department came to talk to me and told me that my social platform account was targeted by the relevant departments. As a member of the focus, I must be cautious in my words and deeds. But they will not say what I did wrong specifically, which accounts of mine have been detected by relevant technology, and which remarks have violated the red line. The ubiquitous Big Brother, the threat of stealth, I feel the pressure and fear firsthand, so their purpose is also achieved .
<br><br>

The counselors and mentors used both soft and hard methods, double attacking. The mentor was responsible for invisible pressure on me to shut me up. Encouraging me to enter the system is probably the ultimate goal of the counselors, but the system is a huge scam; young people with ideas can only change reality if they enter the system? No, they just need to nod and applaud the machine.
<br><br>

After backing up Douban data and registering mastodon, I bid farewell to my friends and neighbors. I want to wean off the Jianzhong platform slowly.
<br><br>

Shouldn't it be lucky that this place is a little better than the world in 1984? At least I can put my thoughts on paper, trusting that the journal won't betray me.
<br><br>

Does being a Chinese carry original sin? As Chinese, we deserve to have our homes ransacked and our valuables destroyed by disinfectant, we deserve to have our passports cut and restricted from leaving the country, and we deserve to buy exorbitantly expensive air tickets to return home. Zhao Lijian asked us to "sneak fun", and only by cutting off children and grandchildren or escaping from birth can we exchange for an indulgence .
<br><br>


<b>May 12</b>
<br><br>

At ten o'clock in the evening, the counselor called me again. I just turned on the recording software to answer, but she hung up again. During the quarter of an hour I waited for a call back, I trembled and engaged in excruciating self-censorship. Finally, she finally made it clear that she wanted me to help find writing materials, and I was relieved.
<br><br>

This has happened too many times. In the past, when I didn't reply in a second in the middle of the night, she directly complained to my parents, which caused more troublesome family conflicts.
<br><br>

She could talk to me again anytime. It was as if I had been taken over by someone, and I couldn't even enjoy the most basic freedom from fear .
<br><br>



<b>May 13</b>
<br><br>

Today, the number released by Shanghai has increased again, and North Korea has also reported multiple confirmed cases. Everyone is paying attention to who will become the bottom one in the class. I hope that creating a war epidemic can really help us "overcome the epidemic".
<br><br>

Students from other places can finally go home one after another. They posted photos, and the students wearing big white protective suits at the station are like alien visitors. Compared with overseas countries that are gradually recovering from the pre-epidemic state, we seem to live in two worlds.
<br><br>

My cousin told me that he was on the last night shift of a shelter in Xinzhuang, and that station was about to be closed due to the gradual decrease in the number of people being transferred. I have another glimmer of hope.
<br><br>



<b>May 14</b>
<br><br>

Since staying at home, I have lost five catties. The last time the scale showed 92, I was still in junior high school. But the near-perfect physical condition made me fall into a deeper depression, lamenting that my youth would be lost in vain. It was night crying.
<br><br>


<b>May 15</b>
<br><br>

In the early morning, I heard the sound of domestic violence downstairs, men's beating and scolding mixed with women's crying, and two old people trying to persuade them to fight. I know that the neighborhood committee will only try to make peace, and the police will ignore it. A woman must be helpless, and I really want to take a knife and go down to help her. I am ashamed to be a silent accomplice!
<br><br>

In the afternoon, I took a walk around the neighborhood and talked to the cats and dogs I haven’t seen for a long time. The old men and women in Gashan Lake are all talking about the unblocking soon; they also said that it would be fun if the unblocking happens to be on May 27, the same day as the liberation of Shanghai in 1949. So my boyfriend logged into my library account on a whim, and checked "Ta Kung Pao". We found that there were new movies released in Shanghai on the eve of liberation, and it was not as tense as we imagined.
<br><br>

And why is our current situation worse than Shanghai in 1949? We have gradually realized that this is not just a matter of wrong general policies and unscientific implementation methods for epidemic prevention. This is a new type of Cultural Revolution under the guise of epidemic prevention. Science pales in comparison to political campaigns.
<br><br>

Farewell, Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science.

<b>May 16</b>
<br><br>

One after another, we saw news that Tsinghua students were threatened with expulsion from their counselors for distributing rainbow leaflets, and Peking University students organized protests because of special treatment for employees' families. Under political pressure, China's two top universities cannot escape pervasive ideological censorship and differential treatment by privileged classes.
<br><br>

The encounter with the classmates in Tsinghua University formed an intertextuality. The counselor specially called and told me not to participate in any lgbtq-related activities tomorrow, and not to forward any related propaganda on the Internet; now I am more convinced that I have hit a certain point Observation list. She called me an "idealist" and brainwashed me with the words "ordering you is actually protecting you, because the Internet has memory, and we don't want your speech to be used by people with intentions"; and she also said that since we are around All homosexuals can be treated friendly, which means that the environment is not as bad as imagined, and there is no need to work hard to speak out. Her underlying logic is actually that sexual minority associations are "off-campus forces", which are the same as "foreign forces", implying unstable factors with bad intentions and subverting the orthodox order. How narrow our space for free expression has become!
<br><br>

I recorded the phone call and listened to it when I got homesick.
<br><br>

My boyfriend tried to interpret the differences between my counselor and me in terms of background - the only thing we had in common was speaking Chinese.
<br><br>

On the one hand, rural people cannot understand the sense of gap in Shanghainese. He said that when he first came to Shanghai, he thought it was a magical place. The people had not experienced too much iron fist, guarding the fragile and fragile ideals of a civilized society; while they had experienced left hooks, right uppercuts and roundhouse kicks since childhood in the countryside. I always ask "why do they do this", and he will answer me "you can't measure a totalitarian country by the standards of a democratic country", because for him magical things happen all the time . What impressed me the most is that he said that in high school, his teacher did ideological work countless times and forced him to study art (the teacher would get a commission for the material fee if he succeeded in persuading him); Junior college (also because of the generous commission), he was not sure that he could take the exam until two months before the college entrance examination. In contrast, our children in Shanghai just took advantage of the closure of the city to experience the taste of an iron fist for the first time.
<br><br>

On the other hand, rural people are more likely to be incited by the movement due to their lower background. He compared epidemic prevention with land reform. The living space of the rural people was squeezed. When the Communist Party came to power and encouraged them to overthrow the landlords, they thought it was absurd at first, but they had to respond to the call, because if the Kuomintang, which represents the propertied class, took the opportunity to come to power, they would never stand up. Therefore, it can be said that the rural people are in a state of "forced to do evil" . The same logic applies to today's epidemic prevention campaign. In the words of my boyfriend's mother, "It's really messed up, and the cleaners are 'up'." The same goes for security groups. According to a friend from Suzhou, they are severely polarized in age. They either hold mobile phones to play King of Glory, or they don’t know how to use related technologies. Their low quality makes most of them take advantage of the opportunity to make trouble. Make things difficult for the people.
<br><br>


However, the same land can breed two completely opposite types of people. One is the extremely rebellious rebel Run Lao Hei, and the other is a grateful Stockholm syndrome patient. Counselors clearly fall into the latter category. She is a survivor of the fierce competition in the countryside. She jumped from the bottom of the countryside step by step to the "Phoenix Girl" in the big city. This process is inseparable from the party's favor, so she will naturally grow into the backbone of the party. She couldn't understand why I, who was born in a big city and has a vested interest in the current system, was still dissatisfied with those in power and asked for trouble to participate in various voice-out activities.
<br><br>

I remembered a joke. Some people say that everyone accumulated grievances during the closure of the city. After the closure is lifted, the wave of middle-class immigrants and the return of migrant workers will make the city lose its vitality. But some people retort that this is impossible. After a group of Shanghainese immigrated overseas, many groups of foreigners rushed in to become new Shanghainese.

Parents said at the dinner table that everything is white terror. Experience told them to speak less and follow the rules completely. Aka frantically disinfected with ultraviolet lamps and alcohol. I can understand that fighting the absurd with the absurd is the way of life here .
<br><br>

Rumor has it that rehearsals for the victory celebration party have already begun. My boyfriend said it was good, as long as the society has confidence in the party, don't compete with us for the track. I also think so, I am not a Buddha who has the ability to save all sentient beings, respect and bless the people who enjoy themselves under the policy of obscurity.

Shanghai issued another notice to clear the society, and everyone knew that this was farting.
<br><br>

When I was queuing up for nucleic acid, I heard rumors that it would be released, and the tone of the old man and lady seemed very confident.

Friends in the defense zone said that the first order restored in their community was garbage sorting. It seems that garbage sorting is the last decent thing in Shanghai .

Grandma talked to herself more and more, maybe she didn't realize it. She has nothing to do at home, living with only one TV, her parents will stop her if she wants to do housework, and she can't read a few words and can't read. At the moment my life is quite fulfilling, even though I am also confined in the room, I have endless papers to write, and thanks to the VPN, the Internet can take me to the whole world. I wonder if I will become so boring when I get old?
<br><br>

Listening to the news while eating dinner, the TV reported that the situation is very good as usual, and that work and production will resume soon, which made me want to cry. I still remember that I was on a casual date on 520 last year. At that time, I really wanted to fall in love. Even if it was just a festival shaped by consumerism, I also wanted to enjoy the special offers for couples in the hotel. Whether life can continue this year is a question, so I can only comfort myself that at least half of my wish has been fulfilled.
<br><br>

I really hate the pariah mentality of my parents when they watch the news. They think the reality is unsatisfactory, but they refuse to change and resist, and are even afraid to talk about it. We seem to be living in an imperial country, and we need to avoid the name of the Holy One. Talking about politics is a crime in itself, and only eunuchs are qualified to tout the emperor's new clothes.

<br><br>

Depression swept over my body, and I cried so much that I couldn't do anything.
<br><br>

It is said that the manifestations of depression include feeling heavier at night than in the morning; in other words, you wake up refreshed in the morning, and as time goes by, the more afternoon, especially at night, the more heavy the mood and the difficulty in doing things. Maybe I'm just showing symptoms of depression, not to the point of being mentally ill.
<br><br>

Lying in bed, unable to listen to class, unable to read books, no energy, no energy, the only hope is that someone can hug and caress me at this moment. Physical contact is my unique way to recharge, and I admit that I am a woman addict. Am I always like this? I don't remember exactly. I used to go out every weekend to take pictures to consume energy, or to focus on literary works. It seems to be a sex addiction after meeting a boyfriend. The pleasant sexual experience has become my balance against other boring events in my life . Therefore, the long-term blockade made me completely out of balance, and I could no longer cheer up. (He laughed at me for talking about sex addiction so well.)
<br><br>

Another discovery is that if I fell into a deep political depression in April, filled with grief and indignation over hot-spot events, then now I only focus on my own life, and I am no longer able to care about things other than myself. I just can't bear it.
<br><br>

The only way to resolve the current depression is to divert attention, and going to bed early is impossible.

Yesterday's tweet "I am a braised princess, I swear to burn all the zucchini in the world after I leave Shanghai" was also reported and deleted. A large part of the reason is that it has a reading volume of 100,000+, which has caused phenomenal forwarding and strong resonance among college students, but in the final analysis, the reason is that it does not match the "positive energy" required by mainstream narratives. It reflects the true state of mind of the closed school students, but no negative emotions are allowed here, and it can be a crime not to applaud hard enough; we only deserve to smile and be grateful, and secretly laugh.

Saw two videos. One is the unblocking video of the security zone released by Shanghai Xuhui Video Account. The comment section is closed, and it is purely for outsiders to watch. Another filmed a reporter interviewing citizens in the subway. When the citizens said something unfavorable, the reporter turned the microphone to one side, and the cameraman immediately changed the camera when he saw the situation was not good. What a newsman like a dog, the owner will pet the dog's head and say good dog when he sees it. What a spring and autumn style of writing, the principle of "don't tell the whole truth, don't tell lies" has become "you can't tell the truth, just tell the lies." How can future generations of historians explore the truth of our history today?

I finally realized the meaning of "clearing the social aspect". It turns out that this means that there is no need to distribute supplies.

Started day after day nucleic acid again. The super penetrating power of the loudspeaker makes people depressed, and parents still insist on using ultraviolet light for disinfection. I try not to think and pay attention to all the stupidity.
<br><br>

There was a malicious hacking incident in the boyfriend's neighborhood. A male resident was tired of the female building team leader knocking on the door and urging him to do nucleic acid tests. After opening the door, he dragged her into the room, chopped off her fingers, and took her as a hostage. The police came to the door and deliberately stabbed the police. It is said that Guan had been in a mental problem for a long time, and doing nucleic acid just hit his nerves. I don't mean to excuse him, it's abhorrent that he only dares to attack women; however, is such a social instability factor less likely to cause a tragedy in a normal society?

I finally got my pass and 4-7pm was my time for a walk.
<br><br>

It's so lively outside! The door was crowded with people, including mothers with children, riders delivering food, and masters shaving their hair along the street. Because the greenery has not been maintained for a long time, a few bugs got on my body after staying under the tree for a while. The only difference from the pre-epidemic era is that there are only bicycles on the road and almost no motor vehicles, as if back in the 1980s.
<br><br>

I didn't run into any roadblocks, and rode all the way to my boyfriend's neighborhood. I usually ride the two bridges for a total of three to four kilometers without panting, but today I have to go all out to get on the bridge. I ran into my ex-boyfriend on the bridge. The management of the boyfriend's community has reached the point of bewilderment. As soon as the boyfriend stepped out of the corridor, volunteers in blue reverse clothes sprayed disinfectant wildly, preventing him from moving forward, let alone approaching the gate. Fuck, I thought to myself. I didn't know until evening that it was because there was another new case in their community today, and the aging community frequently concentrated nucleic acid, so it's no wonder nothing happened!
<br><br>


I had no choice but to ride a bicycle to Binjiang with my ex. He told me a lot of things, the colleges he wants to take the postgraduate entrance examination, the friends who want to run around him, the new gossip about old classmates, and the girl he likes new. What impressed me the most is that he said that there was a house-to-house killing in a junior high school classmate’s community (Changqiao No. 1 Village ): the classmate’s grandparents lived together, and the grandma would be taken away after being diagnosed positive. Grandpa specially cooked several dishes for her Take them to the shelter to eat; but when the disease control came to the door, they brought a group of people, rushed into the house and sprayed everything with disinfectant, including the inside of the refrigerator and the freshly cooked dishes on the table, telling him not to eat. I am heartbroken, this father is pure evil .
<br><br>

Cycling all the way gave me the illusion that normal order had been restored, but the normalized nucleic acid testing booths as far as I could see and Dabai everywhere reminded me that this is an abnormal country . I really want to escape.
<br><br>

I'm not grateful for an improvement in my situation, I'm not even excited. I do not want to slavishly submit to the heinous "them."

I just found out today that my dad's second cousin-in-law passed away. Originally, regular chemotherapy would allow him to live for a few more years, but the hospital was closed for too long and he delayed the treatment, so he died inexplicably. He was a distant relative I never met, but I mourned for him. A short life is only exchanged for a shallow "what can I do?", and the emperor's slave will not reflect.
<br><br>

The boyfriend went downstairs to do nucleic acid, and he didn't bother to bring the key, so he didn't close the door. The old aunt next door kindly reminded him, and he replied, "The law and order is better now, similar to the Cultural Revolution." The aunt smiled and nodded, and stopped talking.
<br><br>

Got into an argument with my dad again. His mentality is to scold the government for all kinds of unreasonable policies on the one hand . He is driven crazy by the inconvenience of buying medicine during the lockdown period and the loudspeaker urging him to make nucleic acid. He even feels that the American police are very quick to deal with the shooting. Freedom to parade; on the other hand , when I said "more and more middle-class young people want to immigrate after the closure of the city/Why don't you try to change" I was so angry that I never tried to resist the unreasonable , and I was restrained by the increasingly closed country Those who cannot go abroad are gloating.
<br><br>

I think most of the lower class people are like this, so they largely deserve it . To put it bluntly, he is a masochist, complaining on the surface, but in fact it is not happy not to suffer.
<br><br>

He treated my grandma in the same way. He said that he was tortured by her stubbornness and childishness every day and became mentally weak. All the problems including high blood pressure and insomnia were caused by her. In order to take on great responsibilities (provided that my mother has also resigned all the year round to take care of the elderly and grandma still has the ability to take care of herself).
<br><br>

He will also infinitely emphasize to me his devotion to this family, just like Michelle Yeoh in the opening credits of "The Universe".

Seeing the news of the unblocking of Pyongyang, I calculated that it took North Korea 18 days, how long will it take Shanghai?
<br><br>

My boyfriend and I have to endure being woken up every day to do nucleic acid, and the endless loud speakers all morning. He said we seemed to be in an endless hell.
<br><br>

Even though we haven't seen each other for a long time, I feel that I love him even more. It's not that he is necessary, it's better to have him. We seem to be each other's life-saving straws from being drowned by the flood of absurdity. Only by grabbing each other can we breathe.
<br><br>



<b>May 30</b>
<br><br>

The unblocking is about to usher in, but I fell into depression again. My mind went blank and I cried all day.
<br><br>



<b>May 31</b>
<br><br>

I got the documents that have been stranded in the customs for nearly half a month, and made an appointment to go to Guangzhou for an interview at the end of June.
<br><br>


<b>June 1</b>
The lockdown was lifted at zero o'clock, and some people were setting off fireworks at the entrance of the community, and there were still people setting off firecrackers until the afternoon. A typical funeral .
<br><br>

There are two types of people who sing praises today . One type has no brains, no memory, and forgets the pain when the scar is healed. The other category is pure bad dicks (the word "bad guy" has a misogynistic color), trying to use the positive energy of grand narratives to silence the voice of suffering in the midst of the torrent. I can forgive the former, but I can curse the latter.
<br><br>

Also, I treat ordinary people who can endure all this with respect and blessing, and if they have the courage to have a child in this place, then I have nothing to say. I am no longer angry with Little Pink. Some kind of life instinct forces me to entertain myself in the cracks , and ingesting anti-thief comments on Twitter is my life-sustaining potion.
<br><br>

I finally met my boyfriend, and the happiness of kissing that moment was too unreal. During the lockdown period, I always told him that I can hardly remember his appearance clearly. When I said "miss you", I was referring to an abstract concept in my mind.
<br><br>



Swiping Reddit to see foreigners making complaints
<br><br>

——it is like as if they had a meeting with omicron so that the number can drop by date
<br><br>

——yea just like they have meetings with GDP
<br><br>



However, all these disasters are far from over.
<br><br>

After the normalization of nucleic acid, the testing kiosks in our community will always be full of old men and women. They have nothing to do, just to go shopping; grab resources with young people who have to go to work. The team of nucleic acid testing is very dense, there is no gap at all, which is a hotbed for virus transmission.
<br><br>

And, as in the early days of the pandemic, we face the fear of losing our freedom at any moment . You have to scan the site code to go anywhere, and your whereabouts are exposed to big data, so there is no privacy at all . In just a dozen hours after the unblocking, I not only heard that a community was tested positive again, and closed management again.
<br><br>

Because I don't want to do nucleic acid, I decided not to go out unless necessary.
<br><br>


Shanghai is not the craziest. A small city in Jiangsu even has environmental testing.
<br><br>


My boyfriend told me that he farted on the subway, and the family of three next door asked each other who did it.
<br><br>

Perhaps this is the practical significance of nucleic acid testing. When one person farts, everyone is asking who did it, forming a social movement and making the people fight among themselves.
<br><br><br>



Is unblocking really regaining the light?
